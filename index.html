                    Hi there, and welcome to my site. My name is Brian Drew and I'm a bartender in Seattle, WA. I was born in Toronto, ONT but grew up in Indiana. I graduated from Carmel High School in 2004 and went to Purdue University for biology. However, I wasn't ready for college so I ended up dropping out after a few semesters and entering the work force doing various Joe jobs before I ended up bartending for the last 10 years!
                </p>
                <p>
                    During those bartending years I ended up entering the computer science program at IUPUI. I really enjoyed my time there and graduated in 2014. Various twists and turn in my life kept me from joining the tech industry, however. I moved out to Seattle with a friend the summer of 2014 and have been bartending at a german pub in West Seattle ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the fall of 2019 I got married to the love of my life. I met her here in Seattle while bartending, so it makes me feel like the "twists and turns" weren't just wasted time. We have a home in Seatac now and we're planning on starting a family in the next couple years. So, I've decided that spending long nights at the pub are not what I want for my family. I'm using this down time during the current pandemic to brush up on my CS skills and get my resume ready to start applying for jobs in the tech industry. 
                </p>
                <h4>Wish me luck!</h4>
