Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I have created I webpage of my favorite things!

-The home page (index.html) 
    -A short profile of me! It has an image of me and some info about my background. I first created my nav bar while working on this page. I make extensive use of bootstrap 4 grid here to layout everything dynamically. I quite happy with how the content stacks as you resize the window. Maybe the image gets too big, though.

-Favourite things page (1.html)
    -Here I LIST some cool things for you. :)
    -I experimented a bit with putting bootstrap rows in rows here and it worked out really well.

-The Toronto Maple Leafs Page (2.html)
    -The perfect time to put some stats in a TABLE!
    -I used a color matching tool to find the exact hex code for the blue in the logo :)

-Thing 3 (3.html)
    -I ran out of content ideas but this page is set up and ready for whatever I want to add.

-Style! (style.scss)
    -included variables for background color and text color
    -included variables for the nav bar names of the pages, as I was unsure what would go in there at first
    -created a boxes parent that I derived my nav box from
    -have multipul examples of scss nesting (#ordered-list #nav-box and table)
    -added some nice hover effects
    -most of the rearrangement due to sreensize was done with bootstrap, however I did include one @media query to shorten the page title if someone is on a small screen
    -added a font from google for a signature
